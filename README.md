# Stave's Prework Study Guide

## I made this website for my UC Davis Coding Boot Camp. I wanted to find a way to practice my coding skills and have a way to jot down any new notes that I discover during my coding journey. That's how making this website from scratch for my notes is the perfect solution! This website gives me a set place to store my notes for my class, and helps me practice building websites. 

## The way I started building this webpage was I built a frame and model of the webpage using HTML. Once I was satisfied with the layout, I started stylizing in CSS in order to give the webpage life and make it pop. I also wanted it to be more appealing to look at, so I'm not just looking at a boring white screen with only text. I then used JavaScript in order to give a bit of interactivity to the webpage.
